  - |
    Ironic-Python-Agent now checks any supplied image format value against 
    the detected format of the image file and will prevent deployments should
    the values mismatch.
  - |
    Images previously misconfigured as raw despite being in another format, 
    in some non-default configurations, may have been mistakenly converted if
    needed. Ironic-Python-Agent will no longer perform conversion in any case
    for images with metadata indicating in raw format.
  - |
    Ironic-Python-Agent *always* inspects any non-raw user image content for 
    safety before running any qemu-based utilities on the image. This is 
    utilized to identify the format of the image and to verify the overall 
    safety of the image. Any images with unknown or unsafe feature uses are 
    explicitly rejected. This can be disabled in both IPA and Ironic by setting 
    ``[conductor]disable_deep_image_inspection`` to ``True`` for the Ironic
    deployment. Image inspection is the primary mitigation for CVE-2024-44082 
    being tracked in 
    `bug 2071740 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/+bug/2071740>`_.
    Operators may desire to set
    ``[conductor]conductor_always_validates_images`` on Ironic conductors to 
    mitigate the issue before they have upgraded their Ironic-Python-Agent.
  - |
    Ironic-Python-Agent now explicitly enforces a list of permitted image 
    types for deployment, defaulting to "raw" and "qcow2". Other image types 
    may work, but are not explicitly supported and must be enabled. This can 
    be modified by setting ``[conductor]permitted_image_formats`` for all 
    Ironic services.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes multiple issues in the handling of images as it related to 
    execution of the ``qemu-img`` utility. When using this utility to convert
    an unsafe image, a malicious user can extract information from a node 
    while Ironic-Python-Agent is deploying or converting an image. 
    Ironic-Python-Agent now inspects all non-raw images for safety, and never
    runs qemu-based utilities on raw images. This fix is tracked as 
    CVE-2024-44082 and `bug 2071740 <https://bugs.launchpad
    .net/ironic-python-agent/+bug/2071740>`_.
  - |
    Images with metadata indicating a "raw" disk format may have been 
    transparently converted from another format. Now, these images will have 
    their exact contents imaged to disk without modification.
upgrade:
  - |
    Deployers implementing their own ``HardwareManagers`` must to audit 
    their code for unsafe uses of `qemu-img` and related methods.
