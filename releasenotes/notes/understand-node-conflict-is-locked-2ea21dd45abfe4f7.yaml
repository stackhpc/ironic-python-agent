    Fixes, or at least lessens the case where a running Ironic agent can stack
    up numerous lookup requests against an Ironic deployment when a node is
    locked. In particular, this is beause the lookup also drives generation of
    the agent token, which requires the conductor to allocate a worker, and
    generate the token, and return the result to the API client.
    Ironic's retry logic will now wait up to ``60`` seconds, and if an HTTP
    Conflict (409) message is received, the agent will automatically pause
    lookup operations for thirty seconds as opposed continue to attempt
    lookups which could create more work for the Ironic deployment
    needlessly.
