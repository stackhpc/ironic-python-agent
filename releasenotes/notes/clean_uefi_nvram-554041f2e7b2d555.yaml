    Adds a deploy step ``clean_uefi_nvram`` to remove unrequired extra UEFI
    NVRAM boot entries. By default any entry matching ``HD`` as the root device,
    or with a ``shim`` or ``grub`` efi file in the path will be deleted,
    ensuring that disk based boot entries are removed before the new entry is
    created for the written image. The ``match_patterns`` parameter allows a
    list of regular expressions to be passed, where a case insensitive search in
    the device path will result in that entry being deleted.
